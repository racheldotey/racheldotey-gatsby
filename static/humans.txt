Hi there, fellow human!

My name is Rachel and I am the human behind this website.
When I'm not busy building apps, I enjoy doing other Earth things like taking walks in the park,
binge-watching Netflix shows, and eating in delicious human foods.

As a human, I take pride in creating websites that are user-friendly and visually appealing.
I also believe in the power of humor and try to inject it into my work whenever possible.

Thanks for taking the time to read this humans.txt file and learn a little more about me.
Let's all continue to embrace our humanity and make the most of our time on this beautiful planet.

Have a great day fellow human.
- Rachel
